## Hi, I am Martin
I am a first-year student of Computer Science at the University of Cambridge.

Apart from school I am working on a sky-learning app called Stellar Guesser which you can check out [here](https://stellarguesser.github.io/). From time to time I also solve some problems from Project Euler and take part in Advent of Code.
