# Hi, I am Martin
I am a first-year student of Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. \
Apart from school I am working on a sky-learning app called Stellar Guesser which you can check out [here](https://stellarguesser.github.io/). From time to time I also solve some problems from Project Euler and take part in Advent of Code.

## Skills
### Overview
**Languages**: Rust, Python, Javascript + learning OCaml \
**Technologies**: git, cargo toolchain, [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) \
**Other**: Writing documentation and tests

### More detailed
For larger projects I use Rust since it provides a lot of safety measures with respect to types, which helps me write much more readable and maintainable code. I also use it when I expect performance to matter. \
In the remaining cases I usually choose between Javascript and Python. If I want to keep the script I mostly use Python, if I want a quick and dirty script I use Javascript and run it in the browser console.
